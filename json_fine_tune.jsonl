Adaptive methods such as simplifying written material, providing diagrams or graphic organisers,  and finding alternatives to movies and lengthy readings can be used for students having difficulties with increased amounts of text. \nFor students needing additional challenge, push the students by engaging in inquiry-based tasks such as designing an experiment or research article on frogs; or ask the students to look for patterns in the data they have collected.\n\nLearning Experiences: \nPrepare:  Introduce the topic of frogs to the students, by showing images or a video, and asking them basic questions on frogs.\nPlan: Discuss the activities and materials students will be using during the lesson, hand out any worksheets and resources they will need. \nInvestigate: Conduct an experiment related to the topic from collected resources and direct the student\ufffds investigation on frog habits in their environment.\nApply: Monthly student project on Frogs - create a postcard with a diagram or painting of a frog and provide facts about frogs on their postcard.\nConnect: By connecting frog\ufffds habitats with their local ecosystems and encourage students to use creative ways to consider their catchment\ufffds impact on frogs to bring external application.\nEvaluate: Following the student project get students to discuss what have they discovered and to evaluate it.\nReflect: Prompt students to either quiz each other on what they learnt during the lesson while looking at their postcards, or have student's reflect individually on key points they discovered about frogs, through writing or drawing.\n\nEducator Assessment: \nThe educator will assess each student by providing a postcard rubric score. The postcard rubric will assess content of the students postcard knowledge and include aspects of design etc. The educator will also access the progress the students made throughout the activities to ensure that the learning objectives have been met.\n\nEducator Reflection:\nThe educator should reflect on the application and objectivity of the lesson that was conducted. Were the activities help to clearly explain and apply the knowledge learned. Was more support and learning needed for struggled students and how, can their learning needs be more met effectively? The educator can adjust or rethink the learning experience in the future if needed to best covered for each area."}

For students needing additional challenge, the teacher can provide more open-ended, exploratory activities that require them to use higher-level thinking skills to answer the questions.\n\nLearning Experiences: \nPrepare: The teacher will explain the overarching concept of a life cycle, as well as identifying what makes the life cycle of a frog unique. The teacher will also review or introduce the terms worm, egg, tadpole, froglets with legs, and adult frog.\n\nPlan: The teacher will go over the following activities for the class: \n1) Watching a video on the life cycle of a frog \n2) Answering a set of written questions about the developmental stages of a frog\n3) Conducting an experiment where students observe changes to 5 live tadpoles\n4) Discussion on the impact of environmental factors on the life cycle and development of frogs\n\nInvestigate: Students will complete the first 3 activities identified. The teacher will use Microsoft Office, and TDS LMS to facilitate learning materials for the students and to guide their investigation.\n\nApply: For the 4th activity, students will work in groups to create an online presentation demonstrating their understanding of the life cycle and development of a frog, and connecting the topic to real-world issues. \n\nConnect: The teacher will lead a discussion with the whole class to draw attention to the ecological importance of frogs and identification of how we can better support frogs.\n\nEvaluate and Reflect: Working as a group, the students will present their online presentations to their peers and receive feedback.

Examples of assessment methods may include presentations, quizzes, D2L LMS, and in-class worksheets. \n\nEducator Reflection:\nThe teacher has reflected on the success and efficiency of the lesson, highlighting appropriate learning processes delivered for the day, topics students learned, and feedback offered. To ensure success next time around, the teacher might consider more student-directed activities, review key concepts much more in-depth, take advantage of sound equipment during presentations, and add more visuals matching a video with animations or translating to real-world scenarios for better student interaction."}
