Lesson Title: Life Cycle of A Frog
Teacher Name: Minal
Subject: Science
Grade: 7
Date: 2023-06-16
Duration: 30 minutes
Key Vocabulary: Tadpole, Adult Frog, Froglet, Egg
Supporting Materials: Live Worksheets, Smart Board, Video, Microsoft Office, Learning Outcome: At the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
• Identify various components (tadpole, egg, froglet, and Adult Frog) of the life cycle of a frog 
• List and explain how the development stages of a frog’s life cycle is related to its environment
• Explain how a frog's metamorphosis has developed over time
Skills: 
• Scientific observation
• Research and factual selection of topic 
• Analytical and creative thinking
• Communicating and evaluative skills 
• Explaining scientific structure processes 
Understanding Concept: 
• Students will understand how amphibians, like frogs, transition from the egg stage to adulthood.
• Students will understand that each species transition is unique and has a profound effect on its survival rate within its environment.

Differentiation: 
For students needing additional support - Offer hands on physical simulations and diagrams for better visual understanding. Break down task to two parts. Assign reading allocated time for learning; with the goal of acquiring basic knowledge.
For students needing additional challenge-Allow students to design amphibian lifecycle in a creative format, lead a complex discussion, and present amongst their peers. Assign extra research and research project 

Learning Experiences: 
Prepare: Teacher will ask students to list two facts that they know about a frog's life cycle and present it in front of students. 
Plan: Teacher will show examples of frogs in the process of transition in order to cover the key sections of the lesson.
Investigate: Students will be engaged in a video to help them understand the entire process of the life cycle. Science materials/experiments will be available for further exploring 
Apply: Students will show usage of the knowledge to create products such as posters, fact sheets, games, diagrams and more as part of an assessment.
Connect: Attribution of the life cycle of the frog’s transition to the environment will be discussed.
Evaluate and Reflect: Varying types of question regarding the topic of transition of frog life cycles will be raised for evaluation.

Educator Assessment: The educator will asses what the students have learned through a quiz, short story/problem solving and creative projects such as posters, fact sheets, etc.

Educator Reflection: Through this lesson, the educator observed that many students were highly engaged in the activities and demonstrated their knowledge to a deeper level. In order to make the lesson better next time, the educator plans to preview more visuals -posters or scientific photos- to the students ahead of time as there are not enough visuals and the class ran short of time. It is important to practice interdisciplinary approach by relating the topic embraced by the sciences to other areas over multiple mediums. the educator will plan the lesson involving various activities to meet all learners needs.
