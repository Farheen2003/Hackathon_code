Lesson Title: Life Cycle of Frogs
Teacher Name: Liah
Subject: Science(Biology)
Grade: 9
Date: 2023-06-15
Duration: 60 minutes
Key Vocabulary: Tadpole, Froglets with Legs, Eggs, Frogs
Supporting Materials: Smart Board, Video, Online Educational Resources, Microsoft Office, TDS LMS 
Learning Outcome:
Knowledge: By the end of this lesson, students should be able to identify and properly name and describe the key stages of a frog's life cycle.
Skills: Students will develop skills in scientific investigation, observation and analysis to better understand the life cycle of a frog.
Understanding: Students should understand how the life cycle of a frog differs from other animals, and how the environment contributes to the frog's developmental stages.

Differentiation: For students needing additional support, the teacher can provide step-by-step instructions on each activity. For students needing additional challenge, the teacher can provide more open-ended, exploratory activities that require them to use higher-level thinking skills to answer the questions.

Learning Experiences: 
Prepare: The teacher will explain the overarching concept of a life cycle, as well as identifying what makes the life cycle of a frog unique. The teacher will also review or introduce the terms worm, egg, tadpole, froglets with legs, and adult frog.

Plan: The teacher will go over the following activities for the class: 
1) Watching a video on the life cycle of a frog 
2) Answering a set of written questions about the developmental stages of a frog
3) Conducting an experiment where students observe changes to 5 live tadpoles
4) Discussion on the impact of environmental factors on the life cycle and development of frogs

Investigate: Students will complete the first 3 activities identified. The teacher will use Microsoft Office, and TDS LMS to facilitate learning materials for the students and to guide their investigation.

Apply: For the 4th activity, students will work in groups to create an online presentation demonstrating their understanding of the life cycle and development of a frog, and connecting the topic to real-world issues. 

Connect: The teacher will lead a discussion with the whole class to draw attention to the ecological importance of frogs and identification of how we can better support frogs.

Evaluate and Reflect: Working as a group, the students will present their online presentations to their peers and receive feedback. At the end of the lesson, the teacher will facilitate a discussion for the students to reflect on what they have learned over the course of the lesson.

Educator Assessment: 
The teacher will assess students performance in various activities throughout the lesson. Examples of assessment methods may include presentations, quizzes, D2L LMS, and in-class worksheets. 

Educator Reflection:
The teacher has reflected on the success and efficiency of the lesson, highlighting appropriate learning processes delivered for the day, topics students learned, and feedback offered. To ensure success next time around, the teacher might consider more student-directed activities, review key concepts much more in-depth, take advantage of sound equipment during presentations, and add more visuals matching a video with animations or translating to real-world scenarios for better student interaction.
