Lesson Title: Life Cycle of Frog Lesson
Teacher Name: Farheen
Subject: Science
Grade: 8
Date: 2023-06-16
Duration: 60 minutes
Key Vocabulary: Egg, Tadpoles, Frog, Froglet
Supporting Materials: Smart Board, Video, Laptops, 
Learning Outcome:
> Knowledge – Students will demonstrate knowledge of the the various stages of a frog’s life cycle such as eggs, tadpoles, frogs, and froglets.
> Skills – Students will be able to explain the growth, development and metamorphosis of different parts of the frog.
> Understanding – Students will understand how the environmental factors affect the frog’s life cycle.

Differentiation: 
For students needing additional support:
> Modifying the task- For students needing extra assistance I would use short sentences and diagrams and visuals for greater clarity. I would also use larger font for text in resource materials. 
> Extra help- Provide one-on-one assistance if remarks among students by provide students with further instruction and breakdown concepts into simpler terms
 
For students needing additional challenge: 
> Offer enrichment work to the students who need it, such as asking them to conduct more research and look more into the process of the frog’s life cycle. 
> Allow some groups to create reports or presentations to display what they have learnt. 

Learning Experiences:
Prepare – Begin the lesson with reviewing the importance of environmental factors on the habitat and lifecycle of different species of frog. Discuss with the students the unique features of the frog’s lifecycle and then show them a video of a frog’s life cycle.

Plan – Introduce the students to the contents of the lesson and explain each step they will go through while learning. Assign students to groups so they can work together throughout the activities.

Investigate – Ask the students to investigate a specific section of the life cycle of the Frog. Using laptops, they will be able to replay and analyse to video and access resources on Habitats.

Apply – Have each student make inferences and correlations of their observations with different areas of Sciences, Maths, and Social Studies.

Connect - Ask them to think what they have uncovered that they can apply outside of the classroom. This can include how environmental factors affect their own habitat.

Evaluate and Reflect - Lead them in a discussion covering the key points from the lesson. Discussion questions will help them recall facts and concepts.

Educator Assessment: 
SET INSTRUCTION - Before the lesson students will have to complete a mini quiz, short essay, or problem with reasoning about stages on the frog’s life cycle to test their prior knowledge. 
MID-LESSON ACTIVITY - The students can work on a jigsaw activity or mind-map related to the life cycle of frogs, and educators can assess their knowledge by asking the students to work but at the same time circular to inspect them with assessment schemes.
POST-LESSON ASSESSMENT - Students submit their reflection on the project- Create a poster summarising key facts taught on the day.

Educator Reflection: 
I found that the activity of investigating and connecting the life cycle of frogs to other issues, such as global warming or specific habitats, challenged the students effectively as they had to really think through their answers. I would like to spend more class time investing in exploring into the difference environmental factors have on the frog’s life cycle. I also would ask them to defend challenges like debates, making it more rigorous.  Additionally, to further improve their engagement, try to make an interest angle where each group is challenge to look deeper into different research topics or challenge them seeking authentic records of the scientific quotations used in the questions or answers.
