Lesson Title: Frogs
Teacher Name: Mila
Subject: Science
Grade: 3
Date: 2023-06-14
Duration: 30 minutes
Key Vocabulary: Frog, Eggs, Tadpoles
Supporting Materials: Live Worksheets, Video, Laptops, Microsoft Office
Learning Outcome:

By the conclusion of this lesson, students will: 
Knowledge:
have improved their understanding of frogs, including eggs, tadpoles, adaptations, and related topics. 
Skills:
be able to observe, classify, explain and analyse scientific live specimens of frogs and frog features. 
Understandings:
gain an understanding of the habitats, life cycles and adaptations of frogs, how they are classified and the importance of their survival. 

Differentiation: 
For students needing additional support, involve them in more hands-on activities. Adaptive methods such as simplifying written material, providing diagrams or graphic organisers,  and finding alternatives to movies and lengthy readings can be used for students having difficulties with increased amounts of text. 
For students needing additional challenge, push the students by engaging in inquiry-based tasks such as designing an experiment or research article on frogs; or ask the students to look for patterns in the data they have collected.

Learning Experiences: 
Prepare:  Introduce the topic of frogs to the students, by showing images or a video, and asking them basic questions on frogs.
Plan: Discuss the activities and materials students will be using during the lesson, hand out any worksheets and resources they will need. 
Investigate: Conduct an experiment related to the topic from collected resources and direct the student�s investigation on frog habits in their environment.
Apply: Monthly student project on Frogs - create a postcard with a diagram or painting of a frog and provide facts about frogs on their postcard.
Connect: By connecting frog�s habitats with their local ecosystems and encourage students to use creative ways to consider their catchment�s impact on frogs to bring external application.
Evaluate: Following the student project get students to discuss what have they discovered and to evaluate it.
Reflect: Prompt students to either quiz each other on what they learnt during the lesson while looking at their postcards, or have student's reflect individually on key points they discovered about frogs, through writing or drawing.

Educator Assessment: 
The educator will assess each student by providing a postcard rubric score. The postcard rubric will assess content of the students postcard knowledge and include aspects of design etc. The educator will also access the progress the students made throughout the activities to ensure that the learning objectives have been met.

Educator Reflection:
The educator should reflect on the application and objectivity of the lesson that was conducted. Were the activities help to clearly explain and apply the knowledge learned. Was more support and learning needed for struggled students and how, can their learning needs be more met effectively? The educator can adjust or rethink the learning experience in the future if needed to best covered for each area.
